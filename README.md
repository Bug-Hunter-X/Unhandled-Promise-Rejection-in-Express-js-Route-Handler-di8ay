# Unhandled Promise Rejection in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js Express applications: unhandled promise rejections within route handlers.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

The issue arises from asynchronous operations within route handlers that don't include comprehensive error handling. If the asynchronous operation (`someAsyncOperation` in the example) rejects, the server will silently crash without providing useful error messages in the console.

The solution involves using `.catch()` to handle any potential rejections from promises, logging errors for debugging purposes, and sending appropriate error responses to the client if necessary.

This example highlights the importance of robust error handling in asynchronous Node.js code to ensure application stability and provide meaningful diagnostic information when issues occur.
